## Gitflow Workflow
![Gitflow Workflow](https://www.joaobrito.pt/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/git-workflow.png)

Gitflow is a workflow that is suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle.

We used these 5 different brances to organized our repository.

## Git Emoji
In this repository we use Git Emoji. Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used.

We use 5 emoji of the Git Emoji cheatsheet:

* :construction: - Work in progress
* :bug: - Fixing a bug
* :bento: - Adding or updating assets
* :sparkles: - Introducing new features
* :recycle: - Refactoring code
